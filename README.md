Project Highlights:

Utilizing Power BI, we've created interactive dashboards that capture the journey of COVID-19 over time.
Visualizing the ebb and flow of confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and active cases through dynamic line charts.
Examining the daily changes in new cases, new deaths, and new recoveries using engaging bar/column charts.
Unveiling the disparities among countries and regions through a top affected countries/regions table.
Calculating critical metrics like Case Fatality Rate, Recovery Rate, and Active Cases Rate to gauge the impact.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) at a Glance:

Total Confirmed Cases: Aggregating the total count of confirmed COVID-19 cases, offering a baseline understanding of the spread.
Total Deaths: Summing up the overall count of reported deaths due to the pandemic, reflecting its severity.
Total Recovered: Calculating the cumulative count of individuals who have successfully recovered from the virus.
Total Active Cases: Summarizing the current count of active cases, providing insight into the ongoing impact.

In-depth Metrics and Ratios:

Case Fatality Rate (CFR): A critical metric calculated by dividing the total deaths by total confirmed cases, offering perspective on the lethality of the virus.
Recovery Rate: Measured by dividing the total recovered cases by total confirmed cases, indicating the effectiveness of medical interventions.
Active Cases Rate: Calculated through the division of active cases by total confirmed cases, helping us understand the current disease burden.

Exploration Through Visualization:

Our project goes beyond numbers; we visualize the data to provide a holistic understanding:

Dynamic line charts capture the temporal evolution of confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and active cases.
Interactive bar/column charts allow you to delve into daily variations in new cases, new deaths, and new recoveries.
A comprehensive table displays the most affected countries/regions, enabling a comparative analysis of the pandemic's reach.
Empowering Understanding and Decision-Making:

By utilizing KPIs and data visualizations, we empower ourselves and our community to:

Gain insights into the scale and dynamics of the pandemic.
Understand the disease's progression, severity, and recovery trends.
Make informed decisions based on real-time data-driven insights
